# MyReads Project 
## Overview:
This is the 7nth project for Udacity's Front End Developer NanoDegree (Part 5 Building with React).
The app is consisted of a collection of books that are placed on three bookshelfs (currently reading, want to read & read) the user can move the books from one shelf to another, remove a book completely from the library, search for books and add new books to the library. The app uses **Udacitys** *Book Lender API!*. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) was used to bootstrap the project.

### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
